This was a project for my Data Structures course at Amherst College.
The assignment involved two parts.
1) To implement a priority queue using a heap to store words with given counts.
2) To implement a dictionary to store words from a given text file and the number of times they appear in that file.

The files CS211CountingDictionaryInterface.java, CS211PriorityQueueInterface.java, and ReadFile.java were given by my professor.
